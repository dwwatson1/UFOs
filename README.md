# UFO Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create dynamic content on webpage with UFO sighting information using Javascript and a CSS framework called Bootstrap. 

## Results of the Analysis

### Analysis Resources
* Data Sources: [UFO Sighting Data](https://github.com/dwwatson1/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
* Software: Javascript, [Bootstrap 4.0.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

### Overview of Results 
To make the analysis of UFO sightings easier and more user-friendly, we needed to build an HTML page with dynamic content that will allow the user to filter through hundreds of sightings for multiple criteria at the same time. 

The top half of the webpage displays a neatly displayed navigation bar, a jumbotron header, and a two-column section below [stylized in CSS](https://github.com/dwwatson1/UFOs/blob/main/static/css/style.css).
